    <p class="lede">A Grocery Store Garlic Obsession</p>
    <p class="copy">
      At first you might think that Professor Patterson was kidding. A little commentary about garlic mentioned here.A little anecdote in passing here. Upon reflection, however, it would become clear that the mentions belied a deep set obessession witht he odiforous bulb. Making many question whether there was vampire trauma in his past. Hilarious!
